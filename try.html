    <p style="text-align:left;">Dear Liam,

<p style="text-align:left;">As you prepare to return home to England, I find myself overwhelmed with emotions that are difficult to put into words. Meeting you online was a twist of fate, one that led to a beautiful, albeit brief, chapter in my life. From our first conversations, I felt a connection, but nothing could have prepared me for the joy and warmth I felt when I picked you up at the airport. I was so nervous, but seeing you for the first time after our two weeks of talking online melted all my worries away.

<p style="text-align:left;">Our time together was nothing short of magical. From trying Filipino foods to exploring famous landmarks, every moment was a new adventure. When you went to Boracay, your photos and videos of the stunning beaches made me yearn to experience it with you. And then you did something so incredible – you booked a flight for me to join you. That first airplane ride of mine led to some of the most unforgettable days of my life.

<p style="text-align:left;">Swimming at the beach, sharing ice creams like Mango Mama, Coco Mama, and Halomango by the shore at night, are memories I will treasure forever. Our newfound love for cheesy oysters, which I promise to learn how to make perfectly, the party boat, and snorkeling – each moment was filled with joy, laughter, and the kind of happiness that only comes from being with someone who truly cares.

<p style="text-align:left;">In just two weeks, you became such a significant part of my life. You helped me overcome my fears, and you made me feel cherished in a way I never thought possible. You are the nicest, sweetest, most loving, and caring man I've ever known. Your kindness and generosity have left a lasting mark on my heart.

<p style="text-align:left;">As you travel back home, know that I will take care of the watermelon floatie and your favorite jacket, keeping them as cherished reminders of our time together. I wish you all the best in your future travels and hope you meet wonderful new friends, because you have a heart of gold.

<p style="text-align:left;">I hope you come back one day so we can continue our adventures and see the world together. Our story started at the airport, and I hope it doesn’t end there. The last time I saw you at the airport, I cried so much, but those tears were filled with gratitude for the beautiful moments we shared.

<p style="text-align:left;">I miss you all the time, and I hope this isn’t just an “airport love story.” You’ve become such a special part of my life, and I’ll always hold on to the hope that our paths will cross again.

<p style="text-align:left;">P.S
<p style="text-align:left;">I wasn't crying while writing this.

<p style="text-align:left;">With all my love,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Patricia</p>
